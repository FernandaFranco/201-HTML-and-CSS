- A class or id should have values that refers to the content of the element, not the appearance.

- HTML comments start with `<!--` and end with `-->`. CSS comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

- bold text with `<strong>` is to show semantic importance; strong importance. `<b>`, on the other hand, is to stylistically offset text (make it stand out from its context); keywords. italics with `<em>` is for stress emphasis. `<i>` is to convey text in an alternative voice like it were placed in quotation marks; foreign words.

- Heading should be used for semantics, not to make text bold or big.

- Text level vs Structural level elements

- `<div>`s provide no semantic value. HTML5 introduced new structurally based elements.

- Font stacks! A list of font families in order of preference. There are some nice examples online to get inspiration from.

### Semantic code
- HTML is the markup. CSS is the style.
- HTML is descriptive. CSS is all about appearances.
